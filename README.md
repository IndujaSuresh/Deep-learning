# Deep-learning cv
1. Implement CNN for classifying an apple's image kept in any 1 of 4 quadrants.
Dataset was collected from kaggle and it was filtered manually to 4 quadrants.
2. Implement MLP from scratch & replace the backpropagation algorithm with any of the latest optimization algorithms.
Mlp was implemented from scratch and the backpropagation algorithm was replaced by Tournament Selection Genetic algorithm
